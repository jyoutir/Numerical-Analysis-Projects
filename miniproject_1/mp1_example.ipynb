    "\n",
    "The `csv` file is then read into https://www.tablesgenerator.com/latex_tables to generate a LaTeX table which can be, for example, pasted into a LaTeX document into Overleaf (see video). Since we want to use the data in a table into a document for human inspection, we want only to save selected data. Specifically, we want to save the values of $S(N)$ corresponding to multiples of 10.   \n",

    "A summation as the one in the exercise can be carry out with a `for` statement, since we are updating the value of the sum $S$ by adding $n^2$ for $n = 1, ..., N$. \n",
    "One starts with $S = 0$, adds $1$ to $S$, so $S$ is updated to $1$. Then one adds $4$ to $S$, and updates $S$ to $5$ and so on. That is, for each value of $n$, get the current value of $S$, add $n^2$, and then update $S$ with the new value. Translated into python:\n",

    "The if statement is used to check conditions and change the behaviour of the program accordingly. In our case, we want to print out $S$ only when $n$ is a multiple of 10. The modulo operation that returns the remainder or signed remainder of a division. If a number $p$ is a multiple of 10 then $p$ modulo 10 is 0, in python, the modulo operation is `%`:\n",

    "Arrays are not a native python object. Arrays are introduced (together with functions for array operations and manipulation) by `numpy`. Writing results into an array and save the array to file is a straightforward way to save results for later use. Then, rather than printing we will store the values of $n$ and $S$ into an array. The array has two columns (one for $n$ and one for $S$) and $N$/10 rows.\n",
