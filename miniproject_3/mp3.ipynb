    "## The tasks\n",
    "1. Plot the two curves to determine a starting point for iteration. Save the graph in a PDF file. \n",
    "*Hint: use `np.linspace` to generate an array with the x values. `np.exp` and `np.sqrt` returns an array with the exp and square root of the elements of the array given in input.* \n",
    "2. Write a function `myfun` that calculates $g(x)$. The function takes `x` and returns the value of the function at `x`.\n",
    "3. Write a function `SimpleIter` that performs the simple iteration to find the abscissa of the intersection point. The function takes the initial guess `x0` and the tolerance `tol`. It returns the list of approximations generated by the simple iteration. To perform the iteration, use a `while` loop that performs\n",

    "   x_n = g(x_{n-1}),\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   while the absolute difference between the approximation of two successive approximation is larger than the tolerance.\n",
    "5. Execute the `SimpleIter` using the starting approximation you estimated from the plot and setting the tolerance to `1e-15`. \n",
    "6. Consider the last value in the list of approximations generated by `SimpleIter` being the reference value. Generate the list of absolute errors, by taking the absolute value of the difference between the approximation and the reference value. \n",
    "*Hint: note that if you subtract a number from a list, it returns a list in which the number is subtracted from each element, similarly taking the absolute value of a list returns the list of the absolute values of the elements).\n",
    "7. Plot the error at iteration $n$ against the error at iteration $n - 1$. Save the graph into a PDF file.  "
